# About this program
This program will take in weather data from a CSV file and sorts it into memory through a map within a BST for fast manipulation.
The user can then select year/months of data they wish to view.
Some of this data includes: 

The average windspeed and sample deviation given a month and year

Average Amient air temp and sample deviation for each month of a year

Total solar radiation for each month of a year in kWh/m2

Press 4 for Average and sample deviation of windspeed ambient air temp, and solar radiation in kWh/m2 for each month of year
